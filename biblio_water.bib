	Abstract = {{The bond dissociation energy (D(0)) of the water dimer is determined by
   using state-to-state vibrational predissociation measurements following
   excitation of the bound OH stretch fundamental of the donor unit of the
   dimer. Velocity map imaging and resonance-enhanced multiphoton
   ionization (REMPI) are used to determine pair-correlated product
   velocity and translational energy distributions. H(2)O fragments are
   detected in the ground vibrational (000) and the first excited bending
   (010) states by 2 + 1 REMPI via the (C) over tilde (1)B(1) (000) <- (X)
   over tilde (1)A(1) (000 and 010) transitions. The fragments' velocity
   and center-of-mass translational energy distributions are determined
   from images of selected rovibrational levels of H(2)O. An accurate value
   for D(0) is obtained by fitting both the structure in the images and the
   maximum velocity of the fragments. This value, D(0) = 1105 +/- 10 cm(-1)
   (13.2 +/- 0.12 kJ/mol), is in excellent agreement with the recent
   theoretical value of D(0) = 1103 +/- 4 cm(-1) (13.2 +/- 0.05 kJ/mol)

@article{simon2011,
	Abstract = {In this article{,} classical Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the microcanonical ensemble are performed on neutral and cationic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species{,} focusing on [FePAH]+ [small pi]-complexes. Their anharmonic mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra in the classical approximation are derived. This approach allows us to describe the influence of the energy of a system on its IR spectrum in terms of band-shifts and broadenings. The MD simulations are performed on a potential energy surface (PES) described at the self-consistent-charge density functional tight-binding level of theory. The PES is benchmarked on DFT calculations{,} showing the validity of the approach for complexes of Fe+ with PAHs larger than coronene (C24H12) that are of astrophysical interest. MD simulations at high temperature show the occurrence of the diffusion of the Fe cation on the surface of the PAH. It proceeds through the edge of the carbon skeleton which is the lowest energy pathway presenting barriers smaller than 1 eV. Although only qualitative information on the band broadenings can be obtained{,} we show that the dependence of the computed positions of the main bands of [C24H12]0/+and [FeC24H12]+ [small pi]-complexes on temperature can be fit by linear laws. The spectral trends determined for [FeC24H12]+ are compared to those of N-substituted [C23NH12]+and [SiC24H12]+ [small pi]-complexes of astrophysical interest.},

   before icy layers are observed, that is at A(V) < 3. In order to explain

Previous UV irradiation studies of anthracene:H 2 O, pyrene:H 2 O, and benzo[ghi]perylene:H 2 O ices at 15 K have shown that aromatic alcohols and ketones, as well as CO 2 and H 2 CO, are formed at very low temperatures. Likewise, here, in addition to the coronene cation, hydroxy-, keto-, and protonated coronene (coronene H + ) are formed. The rate constants for the decay of neutral coronene and for the formation of photoproducts have been derived. It is shown that Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their UV induced PAH:H 2 O photoproducts have mid-infrared spectroscopic signatures in the 5--8 μ m region that can contribute to the interstellar ice components described by Boogert et al. as C1--C5. Our results suggest that oxygenated and hydrogenated PAHs could be in UV-irradiated regions of the interstellar medium where water-rich ices are important.},

As we found in our earlier studies on the photoprocessing of coronene in H2O ice, aromatic alcohols and ketones (quinones) were formed. The regiochemistry of the reactions is described and leads to specific predictions of the relative abundances of various oxidized naphthalenes that should exist in meteorites if interstellar ice photochemistry influenced their aromatic inventory. Since oxidized PAHs are present in carbon-rich meteorites and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and ubiquitous in and fundamental to biochemistry, the delivery of such extraterrestrial molecules to the early Earth may have played a role in the origin and evolution of life.},

In such cold space environments PAHs should condense into H 2 O-rich ice mantles at low temperature and be exposed to ionizing radiation. In this paper we present the first infrared spectra of PAH cations in solid H 2 O generated under conditions that resemble dense molecular clouds. After exposing PAHs in solid H 2 O at 15 K to low doses of UV radiation, we have observed both the vibrational absorptions of PAH cations in the mid-IR and electronic transitions in the near-IR. The PAHs observed as ions in solid H 2 O were naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[ghi]perylene. Peak positions, strengths, and temperature dependence are reported for the detected ion bands, and their astrophysical significance is discussed. These laboratory measurements suggest that absorption bands of PAH cations in H 2 O ice may be observable by astronomers in the near- and mid-infrared.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a near-UV/VIS study of a pyrene:H 2 O interstellar ice analogue at 10 K using optical absorption spectroscopy. A new experimental approach makes it possible to irradiate the sample with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light (7-10.5 eV) while simultaneously recording spectra in the 240-1000 nm range with subsecond time resolution. Both spectroscopic and dynamic information on VUV processed ices are obtained in this way. This provides a powerful tool to follow, in situ and in real time, the photophysical and photochemical processes induced by VUV irradiation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing inter- and circumstellar ice analogue. Results on the VUV photolysis of a prototype sample---strongly diluted pyrene in H 2 O ice---are presented. In addition to the pyrene cation (Py + ), other products---hydroxypyrene (PyOH), possibly hydroxypyrene cation (PyOH + ), and pyrene/pyrenolate anion (Py -- /PyO -- )---are observed. It is found that the charge remains localized in the ice, also after the VUV irradiation is stopped. The astrochemical implications and observational constraints are discussed.},

@article{Bowman2010,
	Abstract = {{Context. Icy dust grains play an important role in the formation of
   complex molecules in the interstellar medium ( ISH). Laboratory studies
   have mainly focused on the physical interactions and chemical pathways
   in ices containing rather simple molecules, such as H(2)O, CO, CO(2),
   CH(4), and CH(3)OH. Observational studies show that polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also abundantly present in the ISM in the gas
   phase. It is likely that these non-volatile species also freeze-out onto
   dust grains and participate in the astrochemical solid-state network,
   but additional experimental PAH ice studies are largely lacking.
   Aims. The study presented here focuses on a rather small PAH, pyrene
   (C(16)H(10)), and aims to understand and quantify photochemical
   reactions of PAHs in interstellar ices upon vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   irradiation as a function of astronomically relevant parameters.
   Methods. Near UV/VIS spectroscopy is used to track the in situ VUV
   driven photochemistry of pyrene containing ices at temperatures ranging
   from 10 to 125 K.
   Results. The main photoproducts of VUV photolyzed pyrene ices are
   spectroscopically identified and their band positions are listed for two
   host ices, H(2)O and CO. Pyrene ionization is found to be most efficient
   in H2O ices at low temperatures. The reaction products, triplet pyrene
   and the 1-hydro-1-pyrenyl radical are most efficiently formed in higher
   temperature water ices and in low temperature CO ice. Formation routes
   and band strength information of the identified species are discussed.
   Additionally, the oscillator strengths of Py, Py(center dot+), and
   PyH(center dot) are derived and a quantitative kinetic analysis is
   performed by fitting a chemical reaction network to the experimental
   data.
   Conclusions. Pyrene is efficiently ionized in water ice at temperatures
   below 50 K. Hydrogenation reactions dominate the chemistry in low
   temperature CO ice with trace amounts of water. The results are placed
   in an astrophysical context by determining the importance of PAH
   ionization in a molecular cloud. We conclude that the rate of pyrene
   ionization in water ice mantles is comparable to the rate of
   photodesorption of H(2)O ice. The photoprocessing of a sample PAH in ice
   described in this manuscript indicates that PAH photoprocessing in the
   solid state should also be taken into account in astrochemical models.}},

@article{chemRev2016,
	Abstract = { The interstellar medium is characterized by a rich and diverse chemistry. Many of its complex organic molecules are proposed to form through radical chemistry in icy grain mantles. Radicals form readily when interstellar ices (composed of water and other volatiles) are exposed to UV photons and other sources of dissociative radiation, and if sufficiently mobile the radicals can react to form larger, more complex molecules. The resulting complex organic molecules (COMs) accompany star and planet formation and may eventually seed the origins of life on nascent planets. Experiments of increasing sophistication have demonstrated that known interstellar COMs as well as the prebiotically interesting amino acids can form through ice photochemistry. We review these experiments and discuss the qualitative and quantitative kinetic and mechanistic constraints they have provided. We finally compare the effects of UV radiation with those of three other potential sources of radical production and chemistry in interstellar ices: electrons, ions, and X-rays. },

@article{Bowman2011,
	Abstract = {{Context. Mid-infrared emission features originating from polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are observed towards photon dominated
   regions in space. Towards dense clouds, however, these emission features
   are quenched. Observations of dense clouds show that many simple
   volatile molecules are frozen out on interstellar grains, forming thin
   layers of ice. Recently, observations have shown that more complex
   non-volatile species, presumably including PAHs, also freeze out and
   contribute to the ongoing solid-state chemistry.
   Aims. The study presented here aims at obtaining reaction rate data that
   characterize PAH photochemistry upon vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   irradiation in an interstellar H(2)O ice analogue to explore the
   potential impact of PAH:H(2)O ice reactions on overall interstellar ice
   chemistry. To this end, the experimental results are implemented in a
   chemical model under simple interstellar cloud conditions.
   Methods. Time-dependent near-UV/VIS spectroscopy on the VUV
   photochemistry of anthracene, pyrene, benzo{[}ghi]perylene and coronene
   containing interstellar H(2)O ice analogs is performed at 25 and 125 K,
   using an optical absorption setup.
   Results. Near-UV/VIS absorption spectra are presented for these four
   PAHs and their photoproducts including cationic species trapped in H(2)O
   ice. Oscillator strengths of the cation absorption bands are derived
   relative to the oscillator strength of the neutral parent PAH. The loss
   of the parent and growth of PAH photoproducts are measured as a function
   of VUV dose, yielding solid state reaction constants. The rate constants
   are used in an exploratory astrochemical model, to assess the importance
   of PAH:H(2)O ice photoprocessing in UV exposed interstellar
   environments, compared with the timescales in which PAH molecules are
   incorporated in interstellar ices.
   Conclusions. All four PAHs studied here are found to be readily ionized
   upon VUV photolysis when trapped in H(2)O ice and exhibit similar rates
   for ionization at astronomically relevant temperatures. Depending on the
   relative efficiency of H(2)O photodesorption and PAH photoionization in
   H(2)O ice, the latter may trigger a charge induced aromatic solid state
   chemistry, in which PAH cations play a central role.}},

   cross sections are determined for water cluster sizes up to ten water
   molecules. The collision results are analyzed in terms of different
   reaction pathways: reactive or nonreactive, sticking or desorption of
   the products or reactants. We show that the HCO radical, although
   potentially formed as an intermediate regardless of the size of the
   water cluster, is significantly stabilized for cluster sizes larger than
   one water molecule and may remain adsorbed on water clusters with more
   than three molecules. This behavior is shown to be linked with the
   dissipation of the collision energy into vibrational excitation of the
   water cluster.}},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of anharmonic effects in the IR spectra of [SiPAH](+) complexes by using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics for a variety of PAHs ranging from naphthalene (C10H8) to ovalene (C32H14). The potential energy surfaces are calculated with the self-consistent charge density functional-based tight binding approach (DFTB). The DFTB parameters are modified to reproduce potential energy surfaces and the harmonic infrared spectra of the studied complexes with respect to DFT calculations. For bare PAHs, we find that the evolution of the vibrational frequencies of the C-H out-of-plane bending and C-C stretching modes as a function of temperature follows a linear law in quantitative agreement with experimental data. For cationic PAHs, the anharmonicity of the bands in terms of position shifts is found to be enhanced with respect to that of neutrals. As compared with bare cationic PAHs, the coordination of Si induces (i) larger broadenings, (ii) a slightly larger shift of the C-C stretching mode, and (iii) a smaller shift of the C-H out-of-plane bending modes. We discuss the implications of the work and the spectroscopic constraints for the detection of [SiPAH](+) in the interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {{Molecular complexes and clusters provide bridges between molecular and
   solid states physics. Containing tens to few thousands of atoms, such
   systems can hardly be approached via traditional ab initio wavefunction
   based methods at the moment. Density functional theory (DFT) and density
   functional based tight binding methods (DFTB) have strongly developed
   with respect to computational efficiency to cover this size range.
   However both DFT and currently implemented DFTB face difficulties to
   describe realistically and accurately the typical interactions met in
   molecular clusters, in particular long range interactions such as
   Coulomb interactions between distant charge fluctuations, charge
   resonance in ionic clusters, and van der Waals interactions. The present
   article aims at providing an overview of how extensions of DFTB can
   circumvent some of the above deficiencies and turn out to be realistic
   and efficient tools to investigate the properties of molecular clusters
   and complexes, focusing on structural, electronic, energetic, and
   spectroscopic properties.}},

   heat capacity curves computed from parallel-tempering molecular dynamics
   and Monte Carlo simulations that were performed using the
   self-consistent-charge density-functional based tight-binding method.
   These curves are characteristic of the phase changes occurring in the
   aggregates and provide useful information on the evolution of the
   interaction between the water molecules and the PAHs as a function of
   temperature. After benchmarking our approach on the water hexamer and
   octamer in the gas phase, we present some results for these same
   clusters adsorbed on coronene and circumcoronene. When compared to the
   curves obtained for the isolated water clusters, the phase change
   temperature significantly decreases for the (H2O)(8)-PAH clusters
   whereas it depends on the nature of the PAH in the case of the hexamer.
   We analyse these differences as connected to the relative energies of
   the optimized characteristic isomers and to their dynamical behavior. We
   also evidence the population changes of the various cluster isomers as a

   the low-energy isomers of (C24H12)(H2O)(1,2) are found to be similar to
   the DFT ones, with evidence for a stabilizing edge-coordination. The
   temperature dependence of the motions of H2O and (H2O)(2) on the surface
   of C24H12 is analysed, revealing ultra-fast periodic motion. The water
   dimer starts diffusing at a higher temperature than the water monomer
   (150 K vs. 10 K respectively), which appears to be consistent with the
   binding energies. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the effects
   of T on the IR spectra are performed. Anharmonic factors in particular
   are derived and it is shown that they can be used as signatures for the
   presence of PAH-water complexes. Finally, this paper lays the
   foundations for the studies of larger (PAH)(m)(H2O)(n) clusters, that
   can be treated with the efficient computational approach benchmarked in
   this paper.}},

	Abstract = {In this paper{,} we report a combined theoretical and experimental study of coronene:water interactions in low temperature argon matrices. The theoretical calculations were performed using the mixed density functional-based tight binding/force field approach. The results are discussed in the light of experimental matrix isolation FTIR spectroscopic data. We show that{,} in the solid phase{,} (C24H12)(H2O)n (n [less-than-or-equal] 6) [sigma]-type complexes{,} i.e. with water molecules coordinated on the edge of coronene{,} are formed{,} whereas in the gas phase{,} [small pi]-interaction is preferred. These [sigma]-complexes are characterised by small shifts in water absorption bands and a larger blue shift of the out-of-plane [gamma](CH) deformation of coronene{,} with the shift increasing with the number of complexed water molecules. Such [sigma] interaction is expected to favour photochemical reaction between water and coronene at the edges of the coronene molecule{,} leading to the formation of oxidation products at low temperature{,} even in the presence of only a few water molecules and at radiation energies below the ionisation potential of coronene.},

	Abstract = {Protonated water clusters have received a lot of attention as they offer tools to bridge the gap between molecular and bulk scales of water. However{,} their properties are still not fully understood and deserve further theoretical and experimental investigations. In this work{,} we simulate the caloric curves of protonated water clusters (H2O)nH+ (n = 20-23). These curves{,} which have recently been measured experimentally{,} are characteristic of the phase changes occurring in the aggregates with respect to temperature. The present simulations are achieved by combining parallel-tempering molecular dynamics and the self-consistent-charge density-functional based tight-binding approach and are focused on a restricted size range around (H2O)21H+ which presents singular properties. The shape of the experimental caloric curves and their size dependence are satisfactorily reproduced by the simulations which allows us to further provide a description of the phase transition in terms of structural modifications{,} dynamics of water molecules and proton mobility. Similar to the experiments{,} we observe that (H2O)21H+ exhibits a sharper phase transition than the neighbouring size clusters{,} which can be traced back to both structural and dynamic peculiarities.},

	Abstract = {Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a family of molecules which represent the best candidates to explain the observation of one set of features in the Interstellar Medium (ISM): the Aromatic Interstellar Bands (AIBs). They could also contribute to the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). In dense molecular clouds{,} PAHs may condense onto interstellar grains{,} contributing to the complex chemistry occurring in their icy mantles{,} composed essentially of water. In this context{,} the adsorption of various aromatic molecules{,} from benzene to ovalene{,} on different ices - both amorphous and crystalline - is investigated by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. Initially{,} a systematic parametrization of the electronic charges on the chosen PAHs in these environments is carried out{,} and benchmarked with reference to free energies of solvation in liquid water. Then we propose a new{,} rigorous methodology{,} transferable to any other PAH or molecular species{,} to evaluate the charges to be applied to the molecule in the gas phase{,} at interfaces{,} or in liquid water. Ultimately{,} the adsorption energies calculated for the various PAHs are used to derive a function predicting the adsorption energy of any PAH on a given ice surface as a function of the number of C and H atoms it contains. For all PAHs studied{,} the largest adsorption energies are found on the crystalline hexagonal ice surface (Ih). Binding energy maps constructed for each PAH-ice pair give valuable insight into adsorption site densities and the barriers to surface diffusion. One key result is that the amorphous surface offers a smaller number of adsorption sites compared to that of hexagonal ice. A direct correlation between the location of energetically favourable adsorption sites and the presence of dangling H-bonds is also demonstrated using these maps{,} showing that PAHs adsorb preferentially on sites offering dangling H-bonds. The present work represents a complete description of PAH-ice interaction in the ground electronic state and at low temperature{,} providing the binding energies and barrier heights necessary to the ongoing improvement of astrochemical models.},

@article{Michoulier18b,
	Abstract = {In dense interstellar environments{,} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are likely to condense onto or integrate into water ice mantles covering dust grains. Understanding the role of ice in the photo-induced processes involving adsorbed PAHs is therefore a key issue in astrochemistry. This requires (i) the knowledge of PAH-ice interactions{,} i.e. PAH-ice adsorption energies and local structures at the PAH-ice interface{,} as well as (ii) the understanding of the fate of electrons in the PAH-ice system upon excitation. Regarding (i){,} in this work{,} we determined the lowest energy structures of PAH-ice systems for a variety of PAHs ranging from naphthalene to ovalene on three types of ice - crystalline (Ih and Ic) and amorphous (low density) - using an explicit description of the electrons and a finite-sized system. The electronic structure was determined using the Self Consistent Charge Density Functional based Tight Binding (SCC-DFTB) scheme with modified Mulliken charges in order to ensure a good description of the studied systems. Regarding (ii){,} the influence of the interaction with ice on the Vertical Ionisation Potentials (VIPs) of the series of PAHs was determined using the constrained SCC-DFTB scheme benchmarked against correlated wavefunction results for PAH-(H2O)n (n = 1-6{,} 13) clusters. The results show a deviation equal{,} at most{,} to [similar]1.4 eV of the VIPs of PAHs adsorbed on ice with respect to the gas phase values. Our results are discussed in the light of experimental data and previous theoretical studies.},
